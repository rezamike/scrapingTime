So this is a mongoose-based web application that allows you to give reviews/rating on your favorite of the "Top 250" films of all time. The listing is provided by a scrape of imDB that's then transferred to a hosted database.

The __*film information*__ scraped is:
* Film Title
* Poster
* Link to imDB page


When clicking on a film title, a modal will come up allowing you to submit your personal review for the film, which will be saved until/unless you delete it.

### This app is meant to help you collect your personal reviews of some of the greatest movies of all time!

Please install npm if using the GitHub repo:
```javascript
npm i
```

#### Thank you, and enjoy!
